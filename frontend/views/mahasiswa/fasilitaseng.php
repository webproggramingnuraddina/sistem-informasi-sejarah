These include the Dean's office building, which was developed with funding from the World Bank when it was still known as IKIP Padang, and two buildings known as Integrated Classroom A and B, which were constructed as part of the Reconstruction and Development Project funded by the Islamic Development Bank in 2016. Specifically for the implementation of the learning process or lectures, there are a total of 30 classrooms equipped with LCD projectors. In addition, internet access with a bandwidth of 1200 Mbps, using fiber optic networks, and many hotspot points are also available to support quality learning processes, especially in providing learning resources for students. Besides the central library, the program management also has reading rooms with a relatively sufficient collection for student needs. Furthermore, there are several other supporting facilities and infrastructure that utilize the facilities owned by UNP, such as auditoriums, sports facilities, hotels, various meeting rooms, and online lectures. All existing facilities and infrastructure can be used by all academic members to optimize the implementation of the Tri Dharma. The management of facilities and infrastructure in the FIS UNP environment is managed by the program, faculty, and university leaders, by allocating funds specifically and sustainably to the department's budget, faculty, and university. For the procurement of facilities and infrastructure, such as building procurement, equipment/media procurement, provision of furniture, classrooms, laboratories, and books, is generally carried out by the department, faculty, and university.</p>

                        <p class="pt-3 pb-2 mb-2 appear-animation" data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter">Padang State University provides shared classrooms. These classrooms are offered for 8 faculties. FIS has adequate facilities and infrastructure in good condition. Each classroom is equipped with standard facilities to support teaching and learning activities, including chairs, whiteboards, LCD projectors, and air conditioning. In addition, there is also a Microteaching laboratory specifically for classroom learning practices. Padang State University provides adequate facilities to support academic activities such as internet connections, <a href="https://portal.unp.ac.id/">Academic Portal</a>, and <a href="https://elearning2.unp.ac.id/">E-Learning</a>. Facilities and infrastructure owned by UNP, FIS, PPG, MKU, health facilities, dormitories, include faculty work rooms, leadership rooms, classrooms, laboratories, meeting rooms, administrative rooms, reading rooms, research center rooms, and student council rooms. The laboratories are interconnected with the EO Matrix. In addition, there are several rooms, such as computer lab rooms, micro-teaching rooms, faculty meeting rooms, and faculty library rooms, which can be used together with other programs within the FIS environment. All rooms in FIS are equipped with air conditioning. FIS facilities to ensure the implementation of high-quality PT tridharma programs are adequate and sufficient. Likewise, the availability of facilities and infrastructure needed has met the specified standards. FIS has three main buildings, namely the Dean's office building, which was developed with funding from the World Bank when it was still known as IKIP Padang, and is equipped with two buildings named Integrated Classroom A and B, which were constructed as part of the Reconstruction and Development Project funded by the Islamic Development Bank in 2016.

Besides the central library, the program management also has reading rooms with a relatively sufficient collection for student needs. Additionally, there are several other supporting facilities and infrastructure that utilize the facilities owned by UNP, such as auditoriums, sports facilities, hotels, various meeting rooms, and the implementation of virtual lectures through <a href="https://elearning2.unp.ac.id/">E-learning</a>.

                        Management of facilities and infrastructure in the FIS UNP environment is overseen by the program, faculty, and university leaders, by allocating funds specifically and sustainably to the department's budget, faculty, and university. For the procurement of facilities and infrastructure, such as building procurement, equipment/media procurement, provision of furniture, classrooms, laboratories, and books, is generally carried out by the department, faculty, and university. Procurement of facilities related to daily needs, which do not require a large budget, is carried out by FIS. The integration of facilities and infrastructure management in the faculty and university allows for shared use (resource sharing) with other departments or faculties; in other words, its utilization can be more effective and efficient, and its procurement and maintenance can be sustainable.</p>
